Automatic Table and Date Search

Created a basic HTML web page and used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects.
Wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
